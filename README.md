# Automatic Differentiation

This library implements forward-mode automatic differentiation in LabVIEW by introducing a new dual number type, implemented via a class, and then primitives and operations on these dual numbers in order to calculate derivatives automatically.

## Dependencies

This library requires LabVIEW 2020 or higher. Malleable VIs are heavily used, and although they were introduced in LabVIEW 2018, LabVIEW 2019 and 2020 contain many fixes for malleable VIs.
